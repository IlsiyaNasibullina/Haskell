# Haskell

This repository contains several projects in Haskell programming language.

In traffic_light.hs I simulated traffic light system for cars, pedestrians and cyclers. https://code.world/haskell#PFrj1Y62Viag1zaWjYv14KQ

In game.hs I implemented the "Escape the room game" with the use of higher-order functions and algebraic data types. https://code.world/haskell#PyBGhVLPO_I_mPMQGI4jq1A

In elevator.c I simulated the elevator system. The code includes parametric polymorphism. https://code.world/haskell#PFXaAIJkiq0FBV_oE44hsyQ

In tick_cross.hs I implemented "Naughts and crosses" game, I also used lazy evaluation in the code. https://code.world/haskell#Po1aiFMdoORkhM_fTgG85Hw

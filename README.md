# Haskell

This repository contains several projects in Haskell programming language.

In traffic_light.hs I simulated traffic light system for cars, pedestrians and cyclers.

In game.hs I implemented the "Escape the room game" with the use of higher-order functions and algebraic data types.

In elevator.c I implemented the elevator system. The code includes parametric polymorphism.

In tick_cross.hs I implemented "Naughts and crosses" game, I also used lazy evaluation in the code.
